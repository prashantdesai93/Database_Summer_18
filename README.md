This project is intended for the creation of a relational database to help Dr. William Patel create a service that allows clients to board thier pets with technicians that can meet their pet's medical needs. The technicians will be certified by Dr. Patel and booked by clients for boarding based on the technician's availability.

To meet Dr. Patel's needs multiple tables will be needed to store information about the clients, the client's pets, the services that are offered, and the technicians. The project will also need a user interface that has access for administration purposes as well as client views. Admin processes will involve adding, deleting, and updating information. Client use will allow for search and table viewing of select information.

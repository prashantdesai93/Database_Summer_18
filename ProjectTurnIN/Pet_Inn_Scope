Project Justification:
	Dr. William Patel is determined to create a service that allows individuals with pets to leave them in the care of people that have
    above average experience and certification. This service is aimed at individuals with pets that have medical needs or require
    additional attention as well as general needs.


	To make this service feasible Dr. Patel will need to create a database that can handle the list of technicians, clients, and their
    pets. A user interface will be needed that allows Dr. Patel and his associates to add, delete, and update information on techs,
    clients, and their pets. The interface will also need to allow clients to join and book a time.
